## Introduction
If you first thought of [Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S.](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.)
when you read this program's name and are expecting a savvy AI system,
you're going to be very disappointed with this product. Here, jarvis
stands for Jerry-rigged Acronym Regarding Versioning Installed Software.
As eluded to by its name, jarvis is a simple and terribly named program
for managing a database contain information on the various software and
databases on a machine, cluster, etc. It is largely intended for system
administrators to document available programs on a system and for
users of that system to query available programs.
